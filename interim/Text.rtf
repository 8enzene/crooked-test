\f0\fs24 \cf0 <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eighteen feature films, more than 40 major characters, 10 years of stories, six Infinity Stones: There\'92s a lot going on in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It may seem daunting to try and recall all that\'92s happened\'a0 before the premiere of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> (the last chapter in this phase of the MCU), and if you\'92re a normal person, you likely don\'92t have time to sit through a 36-hour marathon. So what do you <i>really</i> need to know? </span></p>\
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Never fear, true believer, for here comes my mother, Lee, to the rescue! Hooked on the films while watching them with me as I convalesced from surgery five years ago, she quickly became a Marvel devotee, seeing most of the films in theaters after that. The following is her recollection of the major events in each (minus the three movies she missed \'97 she gives her best guess on those based on seeing the trailers). This may not be <i>the</i> resource for your MCU knowledge, but it is <i>a</i> resource! Take it away, Mom: </span></p>\

Okay, first of all, Iron Man is a rich playboy type guy. <strong>He\'92s not the Charlie Sheen actor. He\'92s the other actor.</strong> So Iron Man has a very fancy place with a lot of fancy cars. He\'92s got a secretary named Penny? No. Pennywise? No. No, that\'92s the clown from <i>It</i>, oh God. Pepper! I knew it was something like that. I know there was a big explosion in his garage. Uh\'85 I don\'92t know how he became Iron Man. Too many iron pills. I don\'92t know. And there was a bad guy. Oh! Robert Downey Jr [is Iron Man]. So now I remember that he was captured and imprisoned in the cave with that other guy, and he had to escape, and he made the iron suit! And when he came out, I think he had a sidekick, I think in the Air Force? Colonel? And then the bad guys came.<span class="Apple-converted-space">\'a0</span>[And there was] somebody like the guy from, um\'85 what was the name of that, uh, Shield? The guy with the eye. Hmm. </span></p>\

Well, I remember that it was the guy that had the brain tumor. That plays the Hulk. In real life he had a brain tumor. I swear! Ohhhh, I\'92m talking about the <a href="https://www.cancerhorizons.com/cancer-champions/actors/mark-ruffalo/">guy in the other movies</a>. The guy in this movie, I don\'92t remember who played the Hulk in this movie. Except that he\'92s a depressed, tortured individual. <strong>Are you sure I saw this movie? Honest to gosh, I blanked this movie out. </strong></span></p>\

Tony\'85 Stark [is his name]. Is this the one where the garage blew up? I don\'92t know one from the other. The bad <em>Iron Man</em>. He becomes an Iron Man in his own suit?<span class="Apple-converted-space">\'a0</span>Well he\'92s not an Iron Man, I guess he\'92s an electric man. There\'92s Fury. There\'92s the Black Widow. <strong>I remember that the Colonel\'92s still in there. He looks different.</strong> I think that\'92s all. </span></p>\

And there\'92s a big circle all around. He comes looking for his hammer! Because the bad brother sent it there? No. He\'92s from\'85 uh\'85 Odin. They live in the sky. They get there by a bridge, a big bridge. Asgar! Wait, Asgard. He needs to learn, I dunno, to be worthy. <strong>He meets some girl on the farm? Natalie Wood. I mean, uh, Natalie Portman.</strong> She was on the farm. The house, in New Mexico. Was she an artist? Oh, she can mind-read? Oh, she\'92s a scientist. Now, does the bad brother Loki come into this? Yes, he\'92s bad. I do remember that he was in there, and that Loki has a sibling rivalry and something going on with Thor, and he gets everything messed up. Bye-bye Loki. But he comes back!</span></p>\

The Hydra head tries to get \'91em. But what happens is that, he is a soldier but he\'92s a little wimp, he\'92s a little skinny guy. And he gets bullied. It\'92s like, oh, during the war, I\'92m gonna say in the \'9130s? \'9140s? Anyway, the scientists get him. <strong>And they inject him with stuff. And he becomes this, like, super human being. Like he gets all buff and handsome.</strong> So anyway, after he gets injected with the stuff and becomes a super soldier... he\'92s not in the elevator yet. Well, the Hydra people are after him. It\'92s World War II. He\'92s gotta go fight. And he has a love interest. She worked for the spies. She\'92s kinda like, she doesn\'92t get the jobs, all the men get the jobs. [And he fights with] his pal Buffy? The slayer? No, Bumpy. Starts with a B! He falls off the train. Buddy? Bucky! I was so close. Oh, he crashes in the plane, and says goodbye to his love. He crashes into an iceberg, into the ice. It\'92s very sad. </span></p>\

So Thor\'92s on the warpath to get him. Loki\'92s killing people. Blowing things up. He wants to be the ruler. The Avengers are: Thor, the Widow, Iron Man, Green Guy \'97 The Hulk \'97 the guy with the arrows\'85 <strong>something Hawk. Hawk Guy.</strong> Captain America, of course. The Avengers win. The mastermind behind it all\'85 the very bad guy. Purple. I don\'92t know his name, but he\'92s very bad. Thanos!</span></p>\

And they\'92re gonna get married and everything. Thor brings her. She finds something in a slab. Red. <strong>Is this the one where Loki gets locked in the cage?</strong> Because he did bad things. Jane finds a red Infinity Stone, they go up to Asgard, he\'92s in love with her but there\'92s too much trouble, so he has to go back to Earth. Just lots of fighting and lots of, you know, the good guys win. The big ships in London and the thing came down right in the middle there\'85 that was cool. That was a good one. [There\'92s the guy] that shows up later, he has all the people in the cages in his place. The Collector. </span></p>\

And he gets in the elevator with his shield, and the bad guys all come in. Hydra? They\'92re after him. Oh yeah, Robert Redford turns out to be a bad guy. He\'92s in there with all the glass, that glass area. When Captain America goes to leave, he\'92s in the elevator, the bad guys are surrounding him, but: piece of cake. He just wipes them out, because he knows it\'92s coming. He gives you that look. Then, uh\'85 then lots of fighting. I think the Black Widow comes. And\'85 Captain something? Birdman? Falcon! And he flies, and he backs him up. <strong>And Bucky is all tormented, he\'92s not himself. He thinks that Captain America\'92s his enemy. Because he has no arm.</strong> Hydra\'92s manipulating him, they\'92ve been making him super strong. Bucky and Captain America fight, and he saves Captain America from drowning. Nick Fury shows up to kill Robert Redford. </span></p>\

Or, his mother did.</strong> But what happens is, he\'92s a little kid, his mom is dying of cancer, he can\'92t bear to be in the room with her because she\'92s dying. But she makes this tape of great music for him, a cassette tape and he has that and he keeps it with him always. And it starts off with him flying around this weird little planet and he\'92s after a relic. And while he\'92s getting it he gets attacked by these other guys that also want the relic, and great music plays. He gets away, and then somehow the green lady comes in. She\'92s a green lady. And then the little raccoon comes in. And then Groot. He\'92s a tree. [He says] \'93That\'92s Groot.\'94 \'93I\'92m Groot.\'94 And [he\'92s] played by the fighting guy. Anyway, at one point they all end up in jail. It\'92s very funny, because then they have to break out, and he just wants his tape back, because the bad guy took the tape. Rocket steals a guy\'92s leg even though he didn\'92t need it. Groot pushes the wrong button, and they all have to quick get to the ship, and they all escape. And then the bad guys are chasing after him. One of the bad guys really isn\'92t a bad guy, it\'92s really a guy that loves him that he used to steal for\'85 kinda blueish. And there\'92s a bad guy with the thing over his face\'85 "Bad Face." They go to the Collector. There\'92s a big fight. </span></p>\

Is this the one with the city up in the air? They gotta save the city, the city\'92s up in the air! Some bad guy came and tore it off. Black Widow wants a relationship [with Hulk], I don\'92t think he wants her at this point, cause he\'92s tortured. And Hawkeye was at the farm with his arrows, his wife and kids, but he has to go fight with the others. Ultron is like a robot, Iron Man made him. The twins are in this, the one girl can do stuff with her hands, and the guy goes invisible real fast. He\'92s superfast. They all end up at this round thing at the end. And somebody dies \'97 the fast guy. The twin is devastated. <strong>I didn\'92t like that the fast guy died. He wasn\'92t fast enough.</strong> And there was something about this other guy who comes and lifts the hammer, and Thor is shocked. Spider-Man! No. Oh, the Vision. He\'92s almost robot-looking too. </span></p>\

Well, the scientist made him small. He\'92s not too crazy about being the size of an ant. And the girl, she helps him, because she\'92s kind of a scientist too. And the bad guy, he tries to be a kind of Ant-Man\'85 a bee? And they fight in the daughter\'92s bedroom. Big battle, but he wins. And the cops come, outside. </span></p>\

Because of something.</strong> So the politicians are mad at all the Avengers, they think they\'92re too risky. They wanna make rules that they have to follow. I think Tony likes [the rules]. That\'92s how they get fighting amongst themselves. I think the Widow was with Captain America. I think maybe the Birdman and Hawkeye [too]. Ant-Man, he was funny. I remember Spider-Man was in there, too. Bucky did something bad, he killed someone. And so, then they fight. Black Panther \'97 I don\'92t know what he\'92s doing \'97 oh, that\'92s when his dad dies. </span></p>\

Peter\'92s dad is Kurt Russell, and then he goes to live with them for a while. <strong>Things went well at first but then they go very bad, because it turns out his dad is wacko. He\'92s got a whole well of skeletons.</strong> He\'92s like a god, he had come down to earth to meet the mother, and that\'92s how he ended up with these powers, because he wasn\'92t supposed to be down there fooling around with the mother. Anyway, in the end, he ends up in a big hole with Rocket. They have to get rescued, and he has to defeat the father. And all his buddies help. Oh, and his fake father who actually did love him dies.

He\'92s not always a good guy. <strong>And the green lady\'92s sister might create trouble.</strong> The Guardians will be there. Captain America will do something heroic. Iron Man will fly.
