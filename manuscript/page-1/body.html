												Eighteen feature films, more than 40 major characters, 10 years of stories, six Infinity Stones: There’s a lot going on in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It may seem daunting to try and recall all that’s happened before the premiere of Avengers: Infinity War (the last chapter in this phase of the MCU), and if you’re a normal person, you likely don’t have time to sit through a 36-hour marathon. So what do you really need to know?

								<p> Never fear, true believer, for here comes my mother, Lee, to the rescue! Hooked on the films while watching them with me as I convalesced from surgery five years ago, she quickly became a Marvel devotee, seeing most of the films in theaters after that. The following is her recollection of the major events in each (minus the three movies she missed — she gives her best guess on those based on seeing the trailers). This may not be the resource for your MCU knowledge, but it is a resource! Take it away, Mom: </p>
